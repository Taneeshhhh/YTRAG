These two fields \\nwere developed based on the concepts that existed before but now they \\nhave been applied to high throughput techniques. Genomics is mainly \\nconcerned with the organization of genes and genomes, the mapping of \\ngenomes, genome sequencing, and the annotation of genomes. \\nProteomics deals with proteins expressed in a cell at different times, \\npost-translational modifications, protein–protein interactions, etc. This \\ncourse covers the important techniques that are used in genomics and \\nproteomics. Investigation of these latest techniques and their \\napplications in various fields will help undergraduate students enhance \\ntheir current perception on biology.\\nReferences:\\n1.

It begins with core \\nconcepts such as VLSI physical design, design automation tools, data \\nstructures, algorithms, graph theory, and computational complexity. The \\ncourse contrasts traditional CAD algorithms with machine learning \\napproaches to address challenges in combinatorial optimization tasks \\nlike partitioning, floor planning, placement, routing, synthesis, and \\ntesting. It also delves into the application of evolutionary algorithms \\n(Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated \\nAnnealing) for placement, and ML models such as K-Means, K-Nearest \\nNeighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forests for chip partitioning, \\ncongestion prediction, and routability-driven placement. The course also \\ncovers ML-based physical verification and mask synthesis methods, \\nincluding layout feature extraction, hotspot detection, and optical \\nproximity correction. Finally, it addresses ML techniques in testing, \\nmanufacturing, yield prediction, and failure modelling using statistical \\nmethods and Gaussian process-based models for high-volume \\nproduction environments \\n*Self-Directed Learning (SDL):  ML for Analog design* \\nReferences: \\n1.

Demonstrate unboxing by \\nautomatically converting wrapper class objects back to primitive types while performing \\narithmetic operations for bill calculation. \\nCreate a main class to: \\ni. \\nInitialize room tariff and number of days using primitive data types and store them in \\nwrapper objects. \\nii. \\nPerform total bill calculation using unboxed primitive values. \\niii. \\nDisplay the final hotel bill. \\n2. Design and implement a Java application to manage room tariff details in a Hotel \\nManagement System using Java enumerations (enum). The application should \\ndemonstrate the use of enum constants, enum constructors, and enum methods. \\ni. \\nDefine an enum named RoomType to represent different types of hotel rooms such as \\nSTANDARD, DELUXE, and SUITE. Each enum constant should be associated with a base \\ntariff value using an enum constructor. The enum should also include methods to return \\nthe base tariff and to calculate the total room cost based on the number of days stayed. \\nii. \\nCreate a main class to select a room type, specify the number of days of stay, and \\ncompute the total room tariff by invoking the enum methods. The application should \\nclearly illustrate how enum constructors are used to initialize constant-specific data and \\nhow enum methods operate on that data.'),\n",
